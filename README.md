Hello and welcome to GiphyPlayground 1.0!

This is my first time ever really playing with gif and local storage.

If you want to take a look at the code everything is clearly commented so you can know what just about every line does but to summarize:

Initially the user starts with three buttons, Cat, Dog, Lizard. Upon clicking these buttons gifs appear below.

Users can click on a gif to stop them from playing at anytime. 

On the right hand side users are free to make more buttons of their own choice. These buttons then appear next to the old ones and act similarly.

Upon clicking reset it will reset the local storage, all non-initial buttons, arrays, and clear the text areas.

Users can also download gifs on a button press!

Have fun!

Coming soon: Having it so that if a user clicks on the same gif/"more gifs" button, more gifs will be loaded.
